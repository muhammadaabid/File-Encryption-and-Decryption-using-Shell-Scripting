# File-Encryption-and-Decryption-using-Shell-Scripting

# **INTRODUCTION**
For securing the data from unauthorized persons or victims, file encryption 
and decryption plays a very crucial role to protect the files. The exponential growth of 
digital data is making the data more unsecure, and the data could be the target of any 
attacker, and it’s our responsibility to make the data as secure. In this context, the 
development of File Encryption and Decryption tools emerges the practical solution. 
With the scripting capabilities of shell, this project aims to create a user-friendly 
environment to encrypt and decrypt the files efficiently, enhancing data confidentiality 
and integrity.
